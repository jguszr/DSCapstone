The Project
========================================================
The Project concept is based on the needs of the SwiftKey company related to "predict" the next word in a text, To do so, a textual dataset were provided in 3 different languages (English, Deusth, Russian and Finland). The key aspect is to use Text Mining and some NLP techniques to build a *dataset* good enough for :  

- Bring some understanding about the general aspect  
- language independant Text Clean-up
- Dataset build
- Identify a good relationship between the dataset size versus the algorithm performance.
